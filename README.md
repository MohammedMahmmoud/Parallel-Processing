# Parallel-Processing
### this repository  has four folders each one containing C program that implement high-performance computing / Parallel processing
#### - one using mpi with MPI_Send and MPI_Recv. that will get two number representing the start and the end and then will send part of these number to each process to count the number of prime number in each part and then calculate the sum of all prime number between that start and end.
#### - another one using mpi with MPI_Bcast and MPI_Allreduce. that will get a number n then each process will generate n random numbers then will calculate the standard deviation of all generated numbers.
#### - another one using openMP. that given a matrix where every element is either ‘O’ or ‘X’, replace ‘O’ with ‘X’ if surrounded by ‘X’. An ‘O’ (or a set of ‘O’) is considered to be surrounded by ‘X’ if there are ‘X’ at locations just left and just right of it. O’s at the edges will not be replaced.
#### - last one using both / hybrid MPI and OpenMP. that calculate the summation for -infinite, number as input- 1/n^2 that will converge to 1, at the end try to reach this result and print the error value as your expected result = 1 ( error = expected - calculated).
